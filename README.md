# euclidean-distances

This R script calculates the Euclidean distances between neighboring immunopuncta. Specifically, it calculates the distance between a given immunopunctum and its closest neighboring immunopunctum. These data (along with immunopuncta IDs) are exported as an Excel file (.xlsx format) for further analysis in R. This protocol requires RStudio, Excel, and Imaris (or equivalent software for calculating x,y,z coordinates for immunpuncta).

Please refer to the manual (.docx file) for instructions.
